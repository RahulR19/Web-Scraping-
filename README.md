# Web Scraping Using Python
This project deals with scraping data from a website and visualising it.

First the data is scraped from the website of Box Office Mojo.

Then the relevant information (Top 10 highest grossing movies of all time) is processed.

Then the data is visualised using a pie chart and a bar graph
